# LogiFix

**LogiFix** is a smart debugging tool designed to help developers **visualize, analyze, and fix logic flow errors** in their code. It provides an interactive way to **trace execution paths, detect anomalies, and optimize decision-making processes**.

## üöÄ Features
- **Logic Flow Visualization**: Graphical representation of code execution paths.
- **Error Detection**: Identify logical inconsistencies and bottlenecks.
- **Code Execution Simulation**: Test different inputs and observe outcomes in real-time.
- **Sui Blockchain Integration**: Store debugging records securely on-chain for transparency and collaboration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, D3.js (for visualizing logic flows)
- **Backend**: NestJS, WebSockets for real-time debugging
- **Blockchain**: **Sui (Move language) for storing debugging records and execution insights**
